# Expass1
by Sondre Lindaas Gjesdal

## Report

As all of the Software Development Environment parts were installed except maven this part went relatively quick.

Second part of the assignment was quite simple. By simply following the tutorial, I was able to stay out of trouble and deploy a fully working Java application using Heroku cloud platform

## Issues encountered

* No real issues encountered. There were some insecureties installing maven, but with the help from a Youtube tutorial this went pain free.

## Validation of Software Development Environment

After installing maven apache, I ran the command ``mvn -version`` to ensure that mvn was installed properly

As I have used JDK, Intellij and git bash a lot from before, I saw no reason to validate that these worked.
